# Python Facebook Graph Explorer

This python script helps you gather any information you want from your own facebook account via the Facebook Graph API. 

First, you'll need to go the the [Facebook Graph Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) select the API v1.0 and generate an access token. This token is good for about an hour. Copy paste that access token to the `token` variable in `fb.py`.

You're all set. You are free to use the graph explorer. Check out the `fb-examples.py` for how to use it.

# Download your Facebook Social network

To download your Facebook social network, open Terminal and run

`python fb-friend-network.py` 

If you get an error, get a new access token and try again.
